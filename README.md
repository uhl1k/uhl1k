### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Roman JankÅ¯. I am a full-stack software developer with programming skills in Java, C/C++ and JavaScript. In addition, I run and administer several Linux servers with different services (databases, applications, web services, ...). I also take interest in hardware and low-level programing in C. If you are looking for my software you are at correct place. I have several repositories with opensource projects of mine, namely
* **Typewriter** - Program for writing novels and poems and organising them
* **8-bit CPU simulator** - Simulation of a very simple 8-bit CPU written in C++
* **Ricart-Agrawala with token** - Implementation of Ricart-Agrawala algorithm for shared variable in Java

just to name a few. I also have a [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/uhl1k) with some images.

However, I am not just a programmer. I also write poems and I publish some of them on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uhl1k1). Unfortunately, they are only in czech but I have been experimenting with other languages recently as well.

In addition, I also play train simulators, namely Trainz 2019 and I do modelling work them. I mostly create content ranging railroad signs thru buildings to accessories. You can download the content [here](https://www.uhl1k.com/trainz).

That's all important information. If you are interested you can find all above and more at my web page at [uhl1k.com](https://www.uhl1k.com).
